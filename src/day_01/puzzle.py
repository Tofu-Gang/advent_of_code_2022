--- Day 1: Calorie Counting ---

The jungle must be too overgrown and difficult to navigate in vehicles or access 
from the air; the Elves' expedition traditionally goes on foot. As your boats 
approach land, the Elves begin taking inventory of their supplies. One important 
consideration is food - in particular, the number of Calories each Elf is 
carrying (your puzzle input).

    """
    The Elves take turns writing down the number of Calories contained by the
    various meals, snacks, rations, etc. that they've brought with them, one
    item per line. Each Elf separates their own inventory from the previous
    Elf's inventory (if any) by a blank line.

    For example, suppose the Elves finish writing their items' Calories and end
    up with the following list:

    1000
    2000
    3000

    4000

    5000
    6000

    7000
    8000
    9000

    This list represents the Calories of the food carried by five Elves:

    -The first Elf is carrying food with 1000, 2000, and 3000 Calories, a total
     of 6000 Calories.
    -The second Elf is carrying one food item with 4000 Calories.
    -The third Elf is carrying food with 5000 and 6000 Calories, a total of
     11000 Calories.
    -The fourth Elf is carrying food with 7000, 8000, and 9000 Calories, a total
     of 24000 Calories.

    By the time you calculate the answer to the Elves' question, they've already
    realized that the Elf carrying the most Calories of food might eventually
    run out of snacks.

    To avoid this unacceptable situation, the Elves would instead like to know
    the total Calories carried by the top three Elves carrying the most
    Calories. That way, even if one of those Elves runs out of snacks, they
    still have two backups.

    In the example above, the top three Elves are the fourth Elf (with 24000
    Calories), then the third Elf (with 11000 Calories), then the fifth Elf
    (with 10000 Calories). The sum of the Calories carried by these three elves
    is 45000.

    those Elves carrying in total?
